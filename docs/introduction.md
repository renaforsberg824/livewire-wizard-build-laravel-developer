**PACKAGE IN DEVELOPMENT, DO NOT USE YET**

This package offers headless Livewire components that allow you to easily build a wizard. With "wizard" we mean a multi-step process in which each step has its own screen.  "Headless" means that our components do not provide any UI themselves, but functionality that will let you easily build any UI you desire yourself.
